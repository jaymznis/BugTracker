# Bug Tracker
#### A new tool developed to create tickets for things to address
<img src="bugtracker.jpg">


## Description

This app currently has two user roles. A normal user can create tickets, comment on tickets, and add attachments to thier tickets.
They can also only edit only things they created.
An Admin user can see everyones tickets and perform crud functionality for everything.
I hope to expand this in time and make it a more full functioned app. I want to add a notification system along with other user roles. I want to add an archive function. I also want to add a reply function and update the comment section. 
It is a work in progress.
